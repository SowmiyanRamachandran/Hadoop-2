Assignment 2.3

All components of Hadoop 1.x :

Hadoop 1.x MapReduce is also know as “Classic MapReduce” as it was developedby following Google’s MapReduce Algorithm Tech Paper.
Hadoop Common Module is a Hadoop Base API (A Jar file) for all Hadoop Components. All other components works on top of this module.
HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V1 as it is part of Hadoop 1.x. It is used as a Distributed
Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.

MapReduce is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module. It is built by following Google’s MapReduce Algorithm.It is also
know as “MR V1” or “Classic MapReduce” as it is part of Hadoop 1.x.
Remaining all Hadoop Ecosystem components work on top of these two major components: HDFS and MapReduce.

Hadoop 1.x Major Components components are: HDFS and MapReduce. They are also know as “Two Pillars” of Hadoop 1.x.

HDFS:
HDFS is a Hadoop Distributed FileSystem, where our BigData is stored using Commodity Hardware. It is designed to work with Large DataSets
with default block size is 64MB (We can change it as per our Project requirements).

HDFS component is again divided into two sub-components:
1.Name Node:
Name Node is placed in Master Node. It used to store Meta Data about Data Nodes like “How many blocks are stored in Data Nodes,
Which Data Nodes have data, Slave Node Details, Data Nodes locations, timestamps etc” .

2.Data Node:
Data Nodes are places in Slave Nodes. It is used to store our Application Actual Data. It stores data in Data Slots of size 64MB by default.

MapReduce:
MapReduce is a Distributed Data Processing or Batch Processing Programming Model. Like HDFS, MapReduce component also uses Commodity
Hardware to process “High Volume of Variety of Data at High Velocity Rate” in a reliable and fault-tolerant manner.

1.Job Tracker:
Job Tracker is used to assign MapReduce Tasks to Task Trackers in the Cluster of Nodes. Sometimes, it reassigns same tasks to other
Task Trackers as previous Task Trackers are failed or shutdown scenarios.
Job Tracker maintains all the Task Trackers status like Up/running, Failed, Recovered etc.

2.Task Tracker:
Task Tracker executes the Tasks which are assigned by Job Tracker and sends the status of those tasks to Job Tracker.

Hadoop 1.x Architecture has lot of limitations and drawbacks. So that Hadoop Community has evaluated and redesigned this Architecture into Hadoop 2.x Architecture.
Hadoop 2.x Architecture is completely different and resolved all Hadoop 1.x Architecture’s limitations and drawbacks.
